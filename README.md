Having Fun with Alan Smith's ACSLogo on OS X

Alan Smith wrote a great Logo Interpreter for the Mac (http://www.alancsmith.co.uk/logo/)

Here you will find a collection of fun little Logo files used to help teach kids basic programming and math skills

I've included examples to do:
  plotting in Polar coordinates i.e. r=cos(3theta)
  recursive functions
  fractals
